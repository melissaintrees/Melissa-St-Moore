# This is a music site made in CSS/JS/HTML/Bootstrap to promote a self-produced 8 song album of electro-dream-indie-pop!
# The process of maintaining this site has been exciting for me because it been a way to test out new web development/design concepts as I learn them. Since the music is currently in an independent phase, I get more creative freedom. I hope that you will listen to the music involved and enjoy it while viewing the site!
