# Music and Moore, St Moore!

I've been making music since I've been making websites to promote the music. This is the site for my eccentric dream-pop musical venture. Also includes some of my new show, Bananas As Fuck!!!!

In the making of the album, I used an Alesis Micron keyboard, for both midi and synthesized sounds, a Rhodes condenser microphone and Focusrite ISA one Pre-amp, and a mac computer with Apple Logic. Some of my friends helped play live to in and sing to it, and I blended that in with the production.
