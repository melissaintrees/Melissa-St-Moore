        <p class="info-info">Melissa St Moore is an eccentric dream pop musician in Chicago, IL. She likes to
          incorporate symbolism in her songs and sometimes paint pictures with words. Her self-titled debut is
          available <a class="span-opport" href="https://melissastmoore.bandcamp.com/">everywhere</a>.
          <br><br>
          A self-taught dancer, conductor of her own train, and comedienne by circumstance, St Moore creates inner and
          outer worlds with her creative mix of sound and vision that defies traditional genres. Her inspiration is
          rooted in the music and art of the 1970s in NYC. She is also influenced by TV on the Radio, the Chromatics,
          and Lana Del Rey. As a performance artist, video antics and glitchy electronics lend themselves to high
          energy vocals, and she has played in many venues throughout LA and NYC, including a spot opening for Nina
          Hagen.
          <br>
          <br>

          Melissa holds a BA from San Francisco State University and studied Film Music at UCLA with award winning
          composer, <a href="http://www.triversmyersmusic.com/" class="span-opport">Elizabeth Myers</a>,
          who advised her in the making of the album. Talented Co-Producer and Engineer
          Jesse String (Leonard Cohen, Nick Jonas) adds a catchy pop sensibility to the arrangements and Grammy
          nominated duo, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=1599374006778834" class="span-opport">The Ditty
            Bops</a>, (Bob Dylan, Natalie Merchant) accent two tracks with atmospheric vocals &
          piano including on a spontaneous rendition of, "Take me Out to the Ball Game!.” Eric A. Harvey, lends a rock
          feel to many of the songs, with his high energy guitar playing and industrialized pedals.
          <br>
          <br> The album is perfect to play in your solar powered space cruise to Mars, or just play it in your car!
