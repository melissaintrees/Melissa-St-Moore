# Music and Moore, St Moore!

I've been making music since I've been making websites to promote the music. In other words, a while - a long fun while! This is the site for my eccentric dream-pop musical venture. I've integrated social media into the site as well as a Mail Chimp email campaign. It is hosted on github pages which is why it is up here on a public repo.

In the making of the album, I used an Alesis Micron keyboard, for both midi and synthesized sounds, a Rhodes condenser microphone and Focusrite ISA one Pre-amp, and a mac computer with Apple Logic. Some of my friends helped play live to in and sing to it, and I blended that in with the production. Then it was mixed and co-produced by a music engineer.
